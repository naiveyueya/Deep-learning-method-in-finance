# Deep-learning-method-in-finance
In this file, I will update as many as deep learning methods i can complish by using Python. Codes are based on package mxnet.

# Deep-Feedforward-Network(file DFN.py)
It shows a possible relization of DFN or MLP. It shows a possibility of retrain model by half learning rate if loss function return NAN.

# Recurrent-Neural-Network(file RNN.py)
I'll update RNN and LSTM later.
